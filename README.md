#  Pituitary Tumor Assessment: Classification, Accumulation Analysis, Treatment Strategies, and Model-based Accuracy
## Features : 
### 1.  Classification: Classifying whether an image contains a tumor or not
### 2.  Accumulation Analysis: Using image processing techniques, quantifies the percentage of tumor accumulation within the brain. This information helps gauge the severity of the tumor's impact on brain tissue.
### 3.  Treatment Prediction: Based on accumulation analysis and classification results, the system predicts whether the tumor necessitates surgical intervention or can be effectively managed through medical treatments.
### 4.  Model-based Accuracy: The project evaluates the performance of different machine learning models for classification and treatment prediction. This involves training and testing various algorithms to ensure reliable and precise outcomes.
